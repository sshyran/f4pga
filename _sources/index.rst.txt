FOSS Flows For FPGA
###################

F4PGA is an Open Source solution for Hardware Description Language (HDL) to Bitstream FPGA synthesis, currently
targeting Xilinx 7-Series, Lattice iCE40 and Lattice ECP5 FPGAs.
Think of it as the GCC of FPGAs.
The project aims to design tools that are highly extendable and multiplatform.
